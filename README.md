# Day8-Cpp-DisplayQtImage
A simple Qt project to display an image upon button click. Part of my [30-Day Programming Challenge](https://showmethecodeblog.wordpress.com/2018/10/08/lets-celebrate/ "Let's Celebrate").

**Note:** In order to get the image to display, you will need to include an absolute path or add the image to the [Qt Resource System](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/resources.html "The Qt Resource System").
